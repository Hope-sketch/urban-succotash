## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level programming language** that is easy to read and write.  
It is widely used for:

- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science and machine learning (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Automation and scripting
- Game development
- Many other applications

Python code is interpreted, which means it runs **line by line**, making it beginner-friendly.
